YAPE: Yet Another PICO ESP32

First rev of a PICO D4 PCB - using board type of Pico Dev Kit : pico32.name=ESP32 Pico Kit

But adds PSRAM: To add PSRAM enable, use boards.local.txt in the hardware\esp32\1.0.6 folder

Otherwise just a pile of test of function sketches. Compared to very similar TinyPICO with PSRAM.

NOTE: Using ESP32 board version 2.0.2 with IDE 1.8.19 at this time
For S2 testing Updated to: esp32\hardware\esp32\2.0.3-RC1


Some online examples use this for OLED SSD1306:

This one for FlappyBird uses that library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzjRDpANjaQ
The source code needed for that is linked in the details and provided there.
